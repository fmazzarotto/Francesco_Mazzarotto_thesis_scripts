# Francesco_Mazzarotto_thesis_scripts
This repository contains some of the scripts that I used to perform the work described in my PhD thesis titled "Characterization of the genetic architecture of dilated cardiomyopathy using families and cohorts", submitted to Imperial College London in December 2015.\n

BURDEN_TEST_FROM_DATABASE_TABLE.txt --> version of 'burden_test' working from tables produced by our in-house database as inputs.\n
BURDEN_TEST_FROM_VCF_FILES.txt --> version of 'burden_test' working from multi-sample VCF files as inputs.\n
ALL_BAL_FILTER_COMPHET.txt --> script to filter candidate variants in the analysed family (chapter 3) on the base of their reference:alternative reads ratio for the autosomal recessive model with compound heterozygosity.\n
RANK_CANDIDATES_AUTOS_RECESS_HOMOZYG_RELAXED.txt --> script gathering several gene-level annotation information in order to allow the raking of candidate variants for the autosomal recessive model with homozigosity (relaxed version, allowing genotype errors to some extent) in the analysed family (chapter 3).\n

Specific information about the single scripts (e.g. input files format etc) is listed in the first lines of each file.
